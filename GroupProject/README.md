-> Description:
Our projects takes a text file that has an unordered list of integers represented by
how they would be written out.
For example:
input.txt -
One
Twenty
Five
Two
Eleven
Seven Hundred Twenty Nine

-> How to Run:
To run the project an input file named "input.txt" will have to be in the same folder as the Main file.
The "input.txt" file will have the unordered input list.

-> Assumptions:
For this project we assumed the following:
1. We were unsure as to the range of the integers in the input file, so we did it from 0 to 999,999,999.
    We felt that it was a big enough number to take into consideration.
2. We assumed that if the number of integers in the input was <= to 19 then the columns would have 4 rows.
    If the number of integers in the list is > 19 the columns would have 9 rows. This was done to match
    the sample output in the instructions.
